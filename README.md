# legacy-json-pfile

The venerable Merc 2.0 codebase introduced a format for storing player files that is still used in Merc, ROM, and Smaug derivative MUDs.  This file from [Age of Legacy](http://ageoflegacy.com) demonstrates a way to implement player files in a JSON format for portability and flexibility.  Please note, this is not a snippet, and will most certainly not work as direct replacement for any Merc-based file.

Please see [this blog post](http://jason.digitalinertia.net/new-tricks-for-old-muds-using-json-for-flexible-player-data/) for details.
